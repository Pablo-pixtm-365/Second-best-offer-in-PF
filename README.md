# Second-best-offer-in-PF
The project was in the research phase so I was in charge of developing a solution to the problem, which was a combination of a market basket analysis and four different classification model  This shows an alternative to recommend the second best product to different customers of a bank, but this does not mean that it can be applied to other fields such as e-commerce, auto service stores or in general to any company engaged in the sale of different products.
